<!-- PHP - Class Constants
Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.

A class constant is declared inside a class with the const keyword.

A constant cannot be changed once it is declared.

Class constants are case-sensitive. However, it is recommended to name the constants in all uppercase letters.

We can access a constant from outside the class by using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name, like here: -->

<?php 

  class Goodbye {
    const LEAVING_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting! <br>";

    function byebye() {
      echo self::LEAVING_MESSAGE;
    }
  }

  echo Goodbye::LEAVING_MESSAGE;

  $goodbye = new Goodbye();
  $goodbye->byebye();

?>


<!-- Or, we can access a constant from inside the class by using the self keyword followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name, like here: -->
